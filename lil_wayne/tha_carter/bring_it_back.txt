[Intro: Mannie Fresh]
Ladies and gentlemen, people with jobs, people without jobs
Middle class, upper class, high class, all that
Cats, snakes, chickens, ducks, elderly people, and twerkers
I presents to you
Fre— Fre— Fre— Fre— Fresh (DJ Mannie)
Fre— Fre— Fresh (Mannie)
Fre— Fre— Fresh (DJ Mannie)
Fre— Fre— (Young ladies)

[Chorus: Mannie Fresh & Lil Wayne]
Put your hands on your knees and bend your rump
Put your back in, back out and do the hump
Put your hands on your knees and bend your rump
Put your back in, back out and do the hump (Well)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & Mannie Fresh]
I'm fly as a son of gun, son of a stunna, yeah
High as a 757 going to Heaven, who?
Weezy F., ya reverend, preach about me
I'm the god, 1-7, Apple and E
I'm the Cash Money Makaveli, y'all ain't ready
Quick, fast like Tom Petty, y'all just petty
'82, I was born ready, I'm too ready
Y'all Betty Crocker baller blockers, I'm too heavy
Meatball, Lamborghini, top spaghetti
Seats Ragu, twenty the shoe
Boo, me and you got plenty to do
I don't need no pool, I'm swimming in you
And I sleep with the sharks, shawty, on that water-water
In the Bimmer 840, mama, shake something for me
And it don't make sense if it don't make that money
I'ma take that money, I'm straight Cash Money (Young ladies)
[Chorus: Mannie Fresh]
Put your hands on your knees and bend your rump
Put your back in, back out and do the hump
Put your hands on your knees and bend your rump
Put your back in, back out and do the hump

[Post-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
A-wodie, a-wodettes (I bring it back to the bottom of the map)
A-wodie, a-wodettes (I bring it back to the bottom of the map)
A-wodie, a-wodettes (I bring it back to the bottom of the map)
A-wodie, a-wodettes (I bring it back to the bottom of the map)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne & Mannie Fresh]
I take off my brim
Moment of silence for the homeboy Soulja Slim, yeah
Fronting 'round here'll get your back chopped off
We do our own thing, we don't act like y'all
I say, black white walls with the back swiped off, ayy
Y'all lil' bustas just a tax write-off
I'm a stand up guy, not the type that fall
We don't breed them kind, but they bleed just fine, yeah
Weezy the Don, homie, read between the lines
If ya can't, boy, read my nine
I'm going hard in the paint like Diesel time
Either I'm the illest cat doing it or these cats is losing it
I'd be easy, fall back and be cool with it
Pallbearer is moving his dead flow, I'm through with it
I'm the shh— nah, nah, I'm sewer-rich
Weezy F. Baby, I do's this (Young ladies)
[Chorus: Mannie Fresh]
Put your hands on your knees and bend your rump
Put your back in, back out and do the hump
Put your hands on your knees and bend your rump
Put your back in, back out and do the hump

[Post-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
A-wodie, a-wodettes (I bring it back to the bottom of the map)
A-wodie, a-wodettes (I bring it back to the bottom of the map)
A-wodie, a-wodettes (I bring it back to the bottom of the map)
A-wodie, a-wodettes (I bring it back to the bottom of the map)

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne & Mannie Fresh]
A old school gangsta mack like the '80s
I look like Cita and act like Baby, yeah
You play with me, I react like the navy
Or better yet the army, you gon' need them for me, yeah
And your head is a bleeping target
You don't want me to see you with my peeping Tommys
Wizzle Fizzle, I keep in New Orleans
Sleeping with women that sleep with the Hornets, yeah
A country boy in something foreign
'Bout a hundred thousand more than what you're in
You're not 'bout it, you freeze up like popsicles
Pop up on bicycles, pop y'all like spot pimples, yeah
Wizzle Fizzle, original Hot Bizzle
Still Lil Wayne, but the dividend's not little, yeah
Don't be surprised how the crown fit him
Uh, get down, uh, get down for the young footprints (Young ladies)
[Chorus: Mannie Fresh]
Put your hands on your knees and bend your rump
Put your back in, back out and do the hump
Put your hands on your knees and bend your rump
Put your back in, back out and do the hump

[Post-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
A-wodie, a-wodettes (I bring it back to the bottom of the map)
A-wodie, a-wodettes (I bring it back to the bottom of the map)
A-wodie, a-wodettes (I bring it back to the bottom of the map)
A-wodie, a-wodettes (I bring it back to the bottom of the map)

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
